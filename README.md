# Importing_Data
In this small project I show how I import data from different formats, like csv, json, html, xlsx and txt =)



This project consists of a Google Colab notebook filling done concurrently with the classes of the course Python Pandas: processing and analyzing data, taught by instructor Rodrigo Fernando Dias from Alura.

Because it is a parallel project to the one developed in class, it is very short, but very objective and descriptive.

I hope I've helped you in some way =)
